# ABCD Pattern Scanner MT5 ReadMe

This code is an implementation of an ABCD pattern scanner for the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. It scans multiple currency pairs and timeframes for ABCD patterns, which are geometric price patterns that can indicate potential trend reversals or continuations in the forex market.

## Installation

To use this code, follow these steps:
1. Download the code files from [here](https://github.com/your-repository-link).
2. Open the MetaEditor in your MT5 platform.
3. Create a new script and copy the code into the script editor.
4. Compile the script by clicking on the 'Compile' button or pressing F7.
5. If there are no errors, the script is ready to use.

## How It Works

The code is divided into several sections:

### 1. Initialize global variables and constants

In this section, the necessary global variables and constants are initialized.

### 2. Start scanning the forex market for ABCD patterns

The `OnTick` function is called on every tick of the market. It contains a loop that scans multiple currency pairs and timeframes for ABCD patterns. Inside the loop, the necessary price data is retrieved, the ABCD pattern detection algorithm is implemented, and potential trend reversals or continuations are checked. Real-time results and performance updates are provided, and necessary trading functions are executed based on detected patterns.

### 3. Clean up and deinitialize the program

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the program is being stopped or deinitialized. It is responsible for cleaning up any resources used by the program.

### 4. Utility functions for pattern detection and trading

This section is reserved for utility functions that can be used for pattern detection and trading. You can add your own utility functions here.

### 5. Additional subscription options for traders
